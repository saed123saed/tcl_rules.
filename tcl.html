<p style="color: aliceblue;"><mark style="background-color: rgb(240, 146, 23);">Please read and respect them .</mark><br>
<ol style="color: aliceblue;">
    <li>The Alliance Chat will only be used with the purpose of giving instructions, giving details if someone aids or share the location of those that aid.</li>
    <li>When rally is made to destroy the garrison city we will use the main line-up.</li>
    <li>In the meantime we will prepare the DM ( Destructive Might ) line-up around the city.</li>
</ol></p>
<br>
<h2 style="color: aliceblue;text-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgb(225, 255, 0),-3px -3px 10px rgb(255, 255, 255);"><ul><li>Instructions when we capture a neutral city !</li></ul></h2>
<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">
<ol style="color: aliceblue;">
<li> An R4 or a designated person will start the rally when the timer is 0:00. This person will be someone who is close to the city, to reduce the time of travel. Please pay attention to the immunity required in order to do 100% damage.</li>
<li>Meanwhile the others will prepare the DM around the city.</li>
<li>After the rally hits the city, we will send the DM and there will be a timer with the title ‘ One hit ‘ + cooldown. While this cooldown is available we will send only one attack, which will give them for everyone to have a chance and participate in the capturing the city and get the rewards.</li>
<li>After this timer is done we will send all DM and finish conquering the city.</li>
<mark style="background-color: blueviolet;color: aliceblue;">Please follow this rules, so that everyone has a chance to participate and get rewards.</mark>

<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">
<ol style="color: aliceblue;">
<li>The shop will be stocked daily based on Alliance Duel day’s requirements. ( Gathering boost for gathering day. Speed ups for Fortress Expansion, Research and Training day) </li>
<li>Additional requests can be made if the shop has a surplus in restocking coins. This will be capped at purchase requests of 25,000 per player per day. </li>
<li>Harman shards are on a list basis. This way we will keep track of who got and who didn’t, to make it fair and available for everyone. You can request to be placed on the Harman list. Once it is your turn for a Harman Shard you will be contacted to have your shard stocked so you can claim it.</li>
<mark style="background-color: brown;color: blanchedalmond;">! The shop will be closed on Sunday !</mark>

<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">
<ol style="color: aliceblue;">
<li> Micro healing of troops – Healing 2-3 troops at a time creates more alliance assists which provides more restocking coins. (EE and AoW day are exempted)</li>
<li> MZ’s Rallies – If is possible to do 2 players per MZ ( mutant zombie ) rally creates more rallies, providing more boxes for the alliance and providing more shop restock coins. Having these systems in place will assist in speeding up player growth. 
    <ul style="color: aliceblue;"><li>( By doing step 2, you will have enough soldiers to do micro healing from step 1 )    </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Daily Alliance Donation. This can be as simply donating food. You are not expected to donate diamonds, but it helps. </li>
<mark style="background-color: brown;color: blanchedalmond;">These systems are being put in place to make purchases fair for players.</mark>
</ol></p>

<h2 style="color: aliceblue;text-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgb(225, 255, 0),-3px -3px 10px rgb(255, 255, 255);"><ul><li>Tile Courtesy.</li></ul></h2>
<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">
<ul style="color: aliceblue;">
<li>We are ALL in different time zones, with different work schedules and different responsibilities.  It is UP TO YOU to err on the side of caution and use COMMON SENSE when taking tiles.  If you see a cluster belonging to one person, don’t take the juicy one in the middle.</li>
<br>
<li>Tile Courtesy – If you see someone making a path to a big field of mines, don’t jump at the end of their line just because they don’t seem to be moving.  They might be asleep, at work, out of energy for their trucks and just waiting to resume.  There are PLENTY of tiles for everyone.  We have SEVERAL cities.  If you think they’re all gone, ask for help finding some, and SOMEONE will help you.</li>
<br>
<li> someone takes a tile you wanted, please don’t rage on them.  Just like last season, there are reports that occupied information is NOT showing up for some people.  Or it might just be a less experienced player.  Message them privately and ask about it.  If they apologize and offer to make amends, let them.  It takes integrity to acknowledge a mistake and try to correct it.  
    In short, when in doubt, ask, and remember that everyone deserves courtesy.  Don’t let anger and insults be your first responses.  “Are you heading that way?”  “Can I tile north off your path?”  “Can we share that cluster of tiles?”  “I was about to take that tile, can you please not block my path?”  “Tile theft” among alliance members are usually just honest mistakes.</li>
</ul></p>
